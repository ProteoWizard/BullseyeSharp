# BullseyeSharp
A C# implementation of the Bullseye algorithm for shotgun mass spectrometry data analysis. With ProteoWizard file support.

BullseyeSharp requires [ProteoWizard](https://github.com/ProteoWizard) to function.

NOTE this is a fork of the project for use with Skyline. The .csproj file that Skyline actually uses for BullseyeSharp is located in pwiz_tools\Skyline\BullseyeSharp - I wanted to minimize changes to the forked files.
